# Wikmd Stub Link Plugin

A [Wikmd](https://github.com/Linbreux/wikmd) plugin to add `[[ stub: some term ]]` links, which will resolve to an article if one exists, or search for an article if not.

This also adds a custom config file to load the plugin and a `search.html` template to suggest a new article from the search page.
